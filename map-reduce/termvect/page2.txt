Across the millennia, the author is speaking, 
clearly and silently, inside your head, directly to you. 
Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, 
binding together people, citizens of distant epochs, 
who never knew one another. Books break the shackles of 
time - proof that humans can work magic.
